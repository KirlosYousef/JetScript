**Live Output**

You will be getting a live output of the executed script.

The possibility to run the script multiple times, just using the stepper.

**Progress Bar**

A small progress bar appears at the bottom to shows the expected remaining time to finish, based on the time elapsed for already finished runs.

Different colors for the language keywords, not all of them are supported; they are so easy to be added, though!
